Spotify Remote
==============

A Google Chrome browser action and panel extension for controlling the Spotify Web Player.

It adds a browser action popup with transport buttons, album art, and track information, that can also be opened as a panel (with the appropriate flag enabled).

GPM steals media keys, so I instead globally registered Ctrl+Shift+7 as previous track, Ctrl+Shift+8 as play/pause, and Ctrl+Shift+9 as next track. On Mac, use
Cmd instead of Ctrl.
